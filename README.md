## Tools/IDE/Library and resources we to use in the Machine Learning
- Numpy -> Open-source library for data preparing and manipulating
- Pandas ->A  library for data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables
- Zipfile -> A library for working with ZIP archives, allowing for compression and decompression of files.
- Matplotlib -> A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
- Sklearn -> A machine learning library offering tools for classification, regression, clustering, and more. However, in this project, it's utilized solely for convolutional metrics.
- Seaborn -> A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, designed for creating informative and attractive graphics.
- Tensorflow -> An open-source framework for machine learning and deep learning, used for building and training models.
- Flask -> A lightweight web framework for building web applications and API in Python, in this project used for building  backend model API.
- API Keras from Tensorflow -> An API running on top of TensorFlow, designed for easy and fast prototyping of deep learning models.
